## 2. Current Onboarding Flow in Victry

### Registration Flow
1. User visits registration page
2. Collects: First name, Last name, Email, Password
3. Sends verification email
4. User clicks verification link
5. Database trigger creates minimal profile (id, first_name, last_name, subscription_tier='free')
6. User redirected to dashboard (currently crashes due to bug)

### Post-Registration Experience (When Working)
1. **Dashboard Landing**: 
   - Shows empty state for new users
   - No resumes, no job descriptions
   - Generic quick actions: "Create new resume", "Browse all resumes"
   
2. **No Guided Experience**:
   - No welcome message
   - No onboarding wizard
   - No introduction to features
   - No AI demonstration

3. **Create Resume Flow**:
   - User must figure out navigation
   - Clicks "Create new resume" 
   - Faced with blank form
   - No templates shown initially
   - No AI assistance highlighted

### OAuth Flow (Google/LinkedIn)
1. User authenticates with provider
2. Callback checks for existing profile
3. If new user: Redirects to `/onboarding/complete-profile`
   - Only asks for first/last name
   - Then redirects to dashboard
4. If existing user: Direct to dashboard

### Profile Completion Page
- Minimal: Only collects first and last name
- No career information
- No goals or preferences
- No value demonstration

## 3. Gap Analysis: Current vs Optimal

#### 1. **No Value Demonstration** ❌
- **Current**: Empty dashboard, no immediate value
- **Optimal**: See AI-enhanced resume within 3 minutes

- **Current**: Generic experience for all users
- **Optimal**: Tailored path based on career stage and goals
- **Impact**: Lower engagement and relevance

- **Current**: AI features hidden behind paywalls and menus
- **Optimal**: AI enhancement shown immediately
- **Impact**: Users don't understand product differentiation

- **Current**: Minimal upfront, then nothing
- **Optimal**: Progressive disclosure throughout journey
- **Impact**: Poor user profiles, can't personalize

#### 5. **No Progress Indicators** ❌
- **Current**: No sense of progress or completion
- **Optimal**: Clear progress bars and checklists
- **Impact**: Users feel lost, don't complete profiles

#### 6. **Empty State Problem** ❌
- **Current**: Dashboard shows nothing for new users
- **Optimal**: Always something engaging to do
- **Impact**: Poor first impression

#### 7. **No Templates or Examples** ❌
