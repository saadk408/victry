## Project Configuration

**Project:** Victry Dark Mode Removal  
**Implementation Plan:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md` (this file)  
**Methodology:** SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)  
**Timeline:** 5 weeks (25 days)  
**Test Coverage Target:** 95%  
**Performance Target:** 25-30KB bundle reduction

## Discovery-First Development Approach

This plan emphasizes exploring and understanding existing research before any implementation. Claude Code should discover what resources are available and use them intelligently rather than looking for specific files that may not exist.

### Research Discovery Pattern

For EVERY task, start with exploration:
1. **Explore Directory Structure**: Use `ls` or directory listing to see what files actually exist
2. **Identify Relevant Content**: Based on the task, determine which files likely contain needed information
3. **Read and Synthesize**: Read multiple files to gather comprehensive understanding
4. **Apply Knowledge**: Use the discovered information to guide implementation
5. **Document Sources**: Note which files provided useful information for future reference

```

### Task 0.6: Explore and Document Resources [x]
```
Create a comprehensive knowledge map of ALL available resources to enable efficient implementation throughout the project.

**Objective**: Document every resource in .claude/memory/ to create RESOURCES.md as the central reference for all subsequent tasks.

**Execution Steps**:

1. Directory Exploration:
   ```bash
   # List complete directory structure with files
   find .claude/memory/ -type f -name "*.md" | sort
   
   # Alternative if find is not available:
   ls -la .claude/memory/
   ls -la .claude/memory/research/
   ls -la .claude/memory/implementation/
   ls -la .claude/memory/test-results/
   ```
   - Document the actual structure found (not assumed)
   - Note any unexpected directories or files
   - Identify work already completed in /implementation/

2. File Analysis:
   For each .md file discovered:
   - Read the first 50-100 lines to understand purpose and scope
   - Identify the main topics covered
   - Note key insights, decisions, or patterns documented
   - Check for cross-references to other files
   - Look for implementation guidance or code examples
   
   Create a preliminary index while reading:
   ```
   File: color-system-spec.md
   Topics: OKLCH colors, semantic tokens, WCAG compliance
   Key Insights: Professional color palette, status colors defined
   Related Files: References color-analysis.md, performance-budgets-quality-gates.md
   ```

3. Create RESOURCES.md:
   Create `.claude/memory/RESOURCES.md` with this exact structure:
   
   ```markdown
   # Dark Mode Removal - Resource Knowledge Map
   
   Generated: [Current Date]
   Last Updated: [Current Date]
   Purpose: Central knowledge map for efficient task execution
   Total Files Cataloged: [Number]

```

### Task 0.7: Identify and Fill Knowledge Gaps [x]
```
Analyze RESOURCES.md to identify and research knowledge gaps that could impact implementation success.

**Prerequisite**: Task 0.6 must be complete with RESOURCES.md available.

**Objective**: Discover what knowledge is missing from the existing documentation and research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps to ensure smooth implementation.

**IMPORTANT**: This task requires you to:
1. Find YOUR OWN gaps based on the actual project documentation
2. Classify them using the CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/NICE-TO-HAVE criteria
3. Research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps
4. The examples throughout this task show FORMAT ONLY - your actual gaps will be different

**Execution Steps**:

1. Gap Analysis Phase:
   
   a) Read all specification files completely:
      - color-system-spec.md
      - tailwind-v4-spec.md  
      - migration-patterns.md
      - migration-strategy.md
      - performance-budgets-quality-gates.md
   
   b) Cross-reference with research files:
      - For each spec requirement, verify research exists
      - Note any implementation details that seem unclear
      - Identify any conflicting information between files
   
   c) Review implementation requirements by phase:
      ```
      Phase 2 (Architecture):
      - Task 2.1: Do we have complete Tailwind v4 setup info?
      - Task 2.2: Are Next.js 15 optimizations clear?
      - Task 2.3: Is testing infrastructure defined?
      
      Phase 3 (Components):
      - Do we understand component migration patterns?
      - Are status color utilities defined?
      - Is the testing approach clear?
      
      Phase 4 (Testing):
      - Are quality gates specified?
      - Do we have performance baselines?
      - Is accessibility testing defined?
      ```
   
   d) Classify each identified gap:
      ```
      CRITICAL (Must Research):
      - Implementation would fail without this
      - No reasonable workaround exists
      - Blocks multiple tasks
      - Core functionality affected
      
      IMPORTANT (Should Research):
      - Implementation would be suboptimal
      - Workaround exists but not ideal
      - Affects quality/performance
      - Worth investing time to get right
      
      NICE-TO-HAVE (Skip):
      - Additional context only
      - Alternative approaches
      - Future optimizations
      - Theoretical understanding
      ```
   
   **Note**: You will research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps. Only NICE-TO-HAVE gaps are skipped.

2. Document Gap Analysis in RESOURCES.md:
   
   Add new section to RESOURCES.md using this format:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Gap Analysis Report
   *Generated: [Date] during Task 0.7*
   
   ### Analysis Summary
   - Files Analyzed: [number]
   - Total Gaps Identified: [number]
   - Critical Gaps: [number]
   - Important Gaps: [number]
   - Nice-to-Have Gaps: [number]
   ```
   
   Then document YOUR ACTUAL FINDINGS using this structure:
   
   **IMPORTANT**: The examples below show the FORMAT ONLY. Your actual gaps will be different based on what you discover in the project files.
   
   ```markdown
   ### CRITICAL Gaps (Must Research)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - Replace with your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name Here]**
      - Why Critical: [Explain why this blocks implementation]
      - Current State: [What exists now in the documentation]
      - Blocks: [Which specific tasks are blocked]
      - Research Needed:
        * [Specific question 1]
        * [Specific question 2]
        * [Specific question 3]
   
   ### IMPORTANT Gaps (Should Research)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - Replace with your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name Here]**
      - Why Important: [Explain the impact]
      - Current State: [What's currently documented]
      - Affects: [Which tasks are affected]
      - Research Needed:
        * [Specific question 1]
        * [Specific question 2]
   
   ### NICE-TO-HAVE Gaps (Acknowledged Only)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - List your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name]**
      - [Brief reason why it's interesting but not necessary]
   ```
   
   **Example to illustrate the format (DO NOT copy these specific gaps):**
   
   If you discovered that animations weren't documented, you might write:
   ```markdown
   1. **Tailwind v4 Animation System Migration**
      - Why Critical: Risk assessment shows 15+ animated components
      - Current State: No animation migration patterns in tailwind-v4-spec.md
      - Blocks: Tasks 3.2-3.7 (all component migrations)
      - Research Needed:
        * v4 syntax for transitions and animations
        * @keyframes in CSS-first approach
        * JavaScript animation integration
        * Performance implications
   ```
   
   But you should document whatever gaps YOU actually find in the project.

3. Research CRITICAL and IMPORTANT Gaps:
   
   For each gap YOU identified as CRITICAL or IMPORTANT, follow this pattern:
   
   a) Search authoritative sources:
      ```
      Priority order:
      1. Official documentation (2024-2025)
      2. Official migration guides
      3. First-party examples/demos
      4. Community best practices (if recent)
      ```
   
   b) Document findings immediately:
      
      **EXAMPLE FORMAT** (your actual content will be different):
      
      If adding to an existing file:
      ```markdown
      ## [Your Gap Title Here]

## SPARC Phase 1: Specification - Modern CSS Architecture [x]

### Phase Overview
```
Transform comprehensive research into actionable specifications that will guide all implementation.

**Purpose**: Create four interconnected specifications that together form a complete blueprint for removing dark mode while improving performance and user experience.

**Critical Mindset - Ultrathink**:
When we say "ultrathink", we mean:
- Synthesize insights from multiple research files
- Consider second and third-order effects of decisions
- Question assumptions and validate with research
- Think about future maintainability, not just immediate needs
- Consider the full lifecycle: development, testing, deployment, maintenance
- Anticipate edge cases and failure modes
```

### Specification Creation Process
```
For EVERY specification task:

1. **Discovery via RESOURCES.md**:
   - Open RESOURCES.md first - it's your navigation map
   - Use Quick Reference Guide for fast topic lookup
   - Check Complete File Inventory for detailed file purposes
   - Review Gap Resolution Summary for newly researched items

2. **Deep Research Reading**:
   - Read identified files completely, not just summaries
   - Take notes on key insights and patterns
   - Look for contradictions or tensions between sources
   - Identify unstated assumptions

3. **Synthesis Through Ultrathinking**:
   - Connect insights across multiple research files
   - Consider implementation realities, not just theory
   - Balance ideal solutions with practical constraints
   - Think about developer experience during implementation

4. **Specification Writing**:
   - Start with the "why" before the "what"
   - Provide concrete, runnable examples
   - Anticipate questions implementers will have
   - Reference specific research that influenced decisions

5. **Cross-Specification Integration**:
   - Each spec should reference others where relevant
   - Ensure consistency across all specifications
   - Identify dependencies between specifications
   - Create a cohesive system, not isolated documents
```

## SPARC Phase 2: Architecture - Foundation Setup [ ]

### Phase Overview
```
Transform Phase 1 specifications into working foundation architecture.

**Purpose**: Implement the core technical foundation based on the comprehensive specifications created in Phase 1, establishing the CSS-first architecture, performance optimizations, and testing infrastructure.

**Critical Approach - Implementation with Specification Guidance**:
- Start EVERY task by consulting RESOURCES.md
- Locate and read relevant specifications from Phase 1
- Apply the integrated specification system (color → Tailwind → migration → quality)
- Document implementation decisions for future phases
- Test against quality gates defined in specifications
```

### Implementation Principles for Phase 2
```
For EVERY implementation task:

1. **Navigate via RESOURCES.md**:
   - Open RESOURCES.md first - it's your implementation guide
   - Use Quick Reference to find relevant specifications
   - Check Phase 1 Specification Insights for critical decisions
   - Review Cross-Reference Matrix for dependencies

2. **Apply Specifications, Don't Reinvent**:
   - Phase 1 specifications contain concrete implementations
   - Use the exact patterns and configurations provided
   - Follow the integration points identified
   - Respect the critical implementation order
   - Always intelligently and effectively use Subagents to perform discovery phases:
      - When multiple files need to read and analyzed, use multiple subagents to read and analyze them in parallel

3. **Test-Driven Implementation**:
   - Write tests based on quality gates from specifications
   - Implement to make tests pass
   - Validate against performance budgets
   - Ensure WCAG compliance per color system spec

4. **Document Implementation Reality**:
   - Create implementation docs in .claude/memory/implementation/
   - Note any deviations from specifications and why
   - Record performance measurements
   - Document lessons learned for Phase 3

5. **Maintain Specification Integrity**:
   - If reality differs from spec, document why
   - Update RESOURCES.md with implementation insights
   - Preserve the integrated system design
   - Think about Phase 3 components while implementing
```

### Critical Reminders for Phase 2

1. **Specifications are Implementation Blueprints**: Phase 1 specifications contain exact configurations - implement them faithfully
2. **Document Reality**: If implementation differs from specification, document why
3. **Think Forward**: While implementing, consider how Phase 3 components will use these foundations
4. **Measure Everything**: Capture metrics for comparison with baselines and targets
5. **Update RESOURCES.md**: This ensures Phase 3 can find everything needed

The foundation built in Phase 2 directly enables the success of all component migrations in Phase 3.

## Discovery-Based Development Guidelines

### Core Principle: Explore, Understand, Analyze, Apply

Rather than looking for specific files that may not exist, Claude Code should:

1. **EXPLORE** the `.claude/memory/` directory structure at the start of each task
2. **UNDERSTAND** what resources are available and how they relate to the current task
3. **ANALYZE** gaps in knowledge that could impact implementation success
4. **APPLY** both existing and newly researched knowledge to implementation decisions

### The Power of Gap Analysis

After exploring what exists (Task 0.5), identifying and filling knowledge gaps (Task 0.6) is crucial because:
- **Prevents Implementation Delays**: Missing knowledge won't block progress mid-task
- **Improves Quality**: Better understanding leads to better implementation decisions
- **Reduces Rework**: Fewer surprises mean fewer revisions needed
- **Strengthens Knowledge Base**: New research benefits all future tasks

### Discovery Pattern for Every Task

```
Task Start:
1. List contents of .claude/memory/ and subdirectories
2. Identify files that seem relevant to the current task
3. Read those files to gather comprehensive understanding
4. Note which files contain useful information
5. Apply the knowledge to implementation
6. Document which resources were helpful
```

### Common Discovery Scenarios

**When looking for "best practices":**
- Check all technology-specific files in /research/
- Look for patterns in migration specifications
- Read any quality gates or performance targets

**When implementing components:**
- Check /implementation/ for prior work
- Look for component-specific guidance in risk assessment
- Find patterns in migration specifications
- Read color system and Tailwind specs

**When writing tests:**
- Look for testing strategies in migration patterns
- Check for quality gates and coverage requirements
- Find accessibility standards in research

**When optimizing performance:**
- Find baseline metrics in research
- Look for performance budgets in specifications
- Check for optimization strategies in technology files

### Identifying Critical Knowledge Gaps

A gap is **CRITICAL** if missing it would:
- Block implementation of a core feature
- Cause significant rework later
- Risk breaking existing functionality
- Violate stated performance or quality targets
- Create security or accessibility issues

A gap is **IMPORTANT** if missing it would:
- Reduce code quality or maintainability
- Make implementation less efficient
- Miss optimization opportunities
- Require future refactoring

A gap is **NICE-TO-HAVE** if it would:
- Provide interesting context
- Offer alternative approaches
- Enhance documentation
- Support future features

Focus research time on CRITICAL gaps only to maintain project momentum.

### File Discovery Tips

1. **Use descriptive searches**: Instead of looking for "latest-standards.md", search for concepts like "CSS patterns", "best practices", "accessibility standards"

2. **Check multiple locations**: Specifications might be in root `.claude/memory/`, while research is in `/research/`

3. **Read file headers**: Most files have executive summaries or introductions that quickly indicate their content

4. **Cross-reference files**: Specifications often reference research, and research files may reference each other

5. **Document discoveries**: When you find useful information, note it for future tasks

### Success Indicators

You're using the discovery approach correctly when:
- ✅ You start each task by exploring available resources
- ✅ You work with what exists rather than searching for missing files
- ✅ You synthesize information from multiple sources
- ✅ You document which resources were helpful
- ✅ You add new discoveries back to the knowledge base

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Searching for specific files that don't exist
- ❌ Skipping tasks because a referenced file is missing
- ❌ Not checking /implementation/ for existing work
- ❌ Ignoring valuable content because it's in a different file than expected
- ❌ Not documenting which resources were useful

Remember: The goal is to leverage ALL available knowledge, regardless of where it's stored. The rich research and specifications from Phase 0 and 1 contain everything needed for successful implementation - Claude Code just needs to discover and use them effectively.

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback Commands
```bash
# Component-level rollback
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- [component-path]

# Feature-level rollback  
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/[feature]/

# Complete rollback
git revert --no-edit dark-mode-removal-start..HEAD
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
```javascript
const rollbackTriggers = {
  errorRateIncrease: 5,      // 5% increase
  performanceDecrease: 20,   // 20% slower
  accessibilityFailures: 1,  // Any failure
  bundleSizeIncrease: 50    // 50KB increase
};
```

## Notes for Claude Code Execution

1. **START with discovery** - Always explore .claude/memory/ before beginning any task
2. **IDENTIFY gaps early** - Use Task 0.6 to fill critical knowledge gaps before implementation
3. **BUILD upon existing work** - Check /implementation/ for work already completed
4. **USE what exists** - Work with available resources rather than searching for missing files
5. **DOCUMENT discoveries** - Note which files provided valuable information
6. **APPLY knowledge** - Use discovered patterns and specifications in implementation
7. **COMMIT frequently** with conventional commit messages
8. **UPDATE progress** in the plan after each task completion
9. **VALIDATE continuously** - Run tests after each change
10. **LEVERAGE all resources** - The rich Phase 0 and 1 work contains everything needed

### Key Success Factors:
- The discovery-based approach ensures flexibility when working with existing resources
- Gap analysis prevents implementation blockers
- Comprehensive specifications and research from Phase 0/1 provide strong foundation
- Progressive knowledge building strengthens the implementation over time
