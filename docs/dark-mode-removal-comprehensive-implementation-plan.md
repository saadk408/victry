## Project Configuration

**Project:** Victry Dark Mode Removal  
**Implementation Plan:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md` (this file)  
**Methodology:** SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)  
**Timeline:** 5 weeks (25 days)  
**Test Coverage Target:** 95%  
**Performance Target:** 25-30KB bundle reduction

## Discovery-First Development Approach

This plan emphasizes exploring and understanding existing research before any implementation. Claude Code should discover what resources are available and use them intelligently rather than looking for specific files that may not exist.

### Research Discovery Pattern

For EVERY task, start with exploration:
1. **Explore Directory Structure**: Use `ls` or directory listing to see what files actually exist
2. **Identify Relevant Content**: Based on the task, determine which files likely contain needed information
3. **Read and Synthesize**: Read multiple files to gather comprehensive understanding
4. **Apply Knowledge**: Use the discovered information to guide implementation
5. **Document Sources**: Note which files provided useful information for future reference

```

### Task 0.6: Explore and Document Resources [x]
```
Create a comprehensive knowledge map of ALL available resources to enable efficient implementation throughout the project.

**Objective**: Document every resource in .claude/memory/ to create RESOURCES.md as the central reference for all subsequent tasks.

**Execution Steps**:

1. Directory Exploration:
   ```bash
   # List complete directory structure with files
   find .claude/memory/ -type f -name "*.md" | sort
   
   # Alternative if find is not available:
   ls -la .claude/memory/
   ls -la .claude/memory/research/
   ls -la .claude/memory/implementation/
   ls -la .claude/memory/test-results/
   ```
   - Document the actual structure found (not assumed)
   - Note any unexpected directories or files
   - Identify work already completed in /implementation/

2. File Analysis:
   For each .md file discovered:
   - Read the first 50-100 lines to understand purpose and scope
   - Identify the main topics covered
   - Note key insights, decisions, or patterns documented
   - Check for cross-references to other files
   - Look for implementation guidance or code examples
   
   Create a preliminary index while reading:
   ```
   File: color-system-spec.md
   Topics: OKLCH colors, semantic tokens, WCAG compliance
   Key Insights: Professional color palette, status colors defined
   Related Files: References color-analysis.md, performance-budgets-quality-gates.md
   ```

3. Create RESOURCES.md:
   Create `.claude/memory/RESOURCES.md` with this exact structure:
   
   ```markdown
   # Dark Mode Removal - Resource Knowledge Map
   
   Generated: [Current Date]
   Last Updated: [Current Date]
   Purpose: Central knowledge map for efficient task execution

```

### Task 0.7: Identify and Fill Knowledge Gaps [x]
```
Analyze RESOURCES.md to identify and research knowledge gaps that could impact implementation success.

**Prerequisite**: Task 0.6 must be complete with RESOURCES.md available.

**Objective**: Discover what knowledge is missing from the existing documentation and research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps to ensure smooth implementation.

**IMPORTANT**: This task requires you to:
1. Find YOUR OWN gaps based on the actual project documentation
2. Classify them using the CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/NICE-TO-HAVE criteria
3. Research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps
4. The examples throughout this task show FORMAT ONLY - your actual gaps will be different

**Execution Steps**:

1. Gap Analysis Phase:
   
   a) Read all specification files completely:
      - color-system-spec.md
      - tailwind-v4-spec.md  
      - migration-patterns.md
      - migration-strategy.md
      - performance-budgets-quality-gates.md
   
   b) Cross-reference with research files:
      - For each spec requirement, verify research exists
      - Note any implementation details that seem unclear
      - Identify any conflicting information between files
   
   c) Review implementation requirements by phase:
      ```
      Phase 2 (Architecture):
      - Task 2.1: Do we have complete Tailwind v4 setup info?
      - Task 2.2: Are Next.js 15 optimizations clear?
      - Task 2.3: Is testing infrastructure defined?
      
      Phase 3 (Components):
      - Do we understand component migration patterns?
      - Are status color utilities defined?
      - Is the testing approach clear?
      
      Phase 4 (Testing):
      - Are quality gates specified?
      - Do we have performance baselines?
      - Is accessibility testing defined?
      ```
   
   d) Classify each identified gap:
      ```
      CRITICAL (Must Research):
      - Implementation would fail without this
      - No reasonable workaround exists
      - Blocks multiple tasks
      - Core functionality affected
      
      IMPORTANT (Should Research):
      - Implementation would be suboptimal
      - Workaround exists but not ideal
      - Affects quality/performance
      - Worth investing time to get right
      
      NICE-TO-HAVE (Skip):
      - Additional context only
      - Alternative approaches
      - Future optimizations
      - Theoretical understanding
      ```
   
   **Note**: You will research both CRITICAL and IMPORTANT gaps. Only NICE-TO-HAVE gaps are skipped.

2. Document Gap Analysis in RESOURCES.md:
   
   Add new section to RESOURCES.md using this format:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Gap Analysis Report
   *Generated: [Date] during Task 0.7*
   
   ### Analysis Summary
   - Files Analyzed: [number]
   - Total Gaps Identified: [number]
   - Critical Gaps: [number]
   - Important Gaps: [number]
   - Nice-to-Have Gaps: [number]
   ```
   
   Then document YOUR ACTUAL FINDINGS using this structure:
   
   **IMPORTANT**: The examples below show the FORMAT ONLY. Your actual gaps will be different based on what you discover in the project files.
   
   ```markdown
   ### CRITICAL Gaps (Must Research)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - Replace with your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name Here]**
      - Why Critical: [Explain why this blocks implementation]
      - Current State: [What exists now in the documentation]
      - Blocks: [Which specific tasks are blocked]
      - Research Needed:
        * [Specific question 1]
        * [Specific question 2]
        * [Specific question 3]
   
   ### IMPORTANT Gaps (Should Research)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - Replace with your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name Here]**
      - Why Important: [Explain the impact]
      - Current State: [What's currently documented]
      - Affects: [Which tasks are affected]
      - Research Needed:
        * [Specific question 1]
        * [Specific question 2]
   
   ### NICE-TO-HAVE Gaps (Acknowledged Only)
   
   [EXAMPLE FORMAT - List your actual findings:]
   
   1. **[Your Gap Name]**
      - [Brief reason why it's interesting but not necessary]
   ```
   
   **Example to illustrate the format (DO NOT copy these specific gaps):**
   
   If you discovered that animations weren't documented, you might write:
   ```markdown
   1. **Tailwind v4 Animation System Migration**
      - Why Critical: Risk assessment shows 15+ animated components
      - Current State: No animation migration patterns in tailwind-v4-spec.md
      - Blocks: Tasks 3.2-3.7 (all component migrations)
      - Research Needed:
        * v4 syntax for transitions and animations
        * @keyframes in CSS-first approach
        * JavaScript animation integration
        * Performance implications
   ```
   
   But you should document whatever gaps YOU actually find in the project.

3. Research CRITICAL and IMPORTANT Gaps:
   
   For each gap YOU identified as CRITICAL or IMPORTANT, follow this pattern:
   
   a) Search authoritative sources:
      ```
      Priority order:
      1. Official documentation (2024-2025)
      2. Official migration guides
      3. First-party examples/demos
      4. Community best practices (if recent)
      ```
   
   b) Document findings immediately:
      
      **EXAMPLE FORMAT** (your actual content will be different):
      
      If adding to an existing file:
      ```markdown

## SPARC Phase 1: Specification - Modern CSS Architecture [x]

### Phase Overview
```
Transform comprehensive research into actionable specifications that will guide all implementation.

**Purpose**: Create four interconnected specifications that together form a complete blueprint for removing dark mode while improving performance and user experience.

**Critical Mindset - Ultrathink**:
When we say "ultrathink", we mean:
- Synthesize insights from multiple research files
- Consider second and third-order effects of decisions
- Question assumptions and validate with research
- Think about future maintainability, not just immediate needs
- Consider the full lifecycle: development, testing, deployment, maintenance
- Anticipate edge cases and failure modes
```

### Specification Creation Process
```
For EVERY specification task:

1. **Discovery via RESOURCES.md**:
   - Open RESOURCES.md first - it's your navigation map
   - Use Quick Reference Guide for fast topic lookup
   - Check Complete File Inventory for detailed file purposes
   - Review Gap Resolution Summary for newly researched items

2. **Deep Research Reading**:
   - Read identified files completely, not just summaries
   - Take notes on key insights and patterns
   - Look for contradictions or tensions between sources
   - Identify unstated assumptions

3. **Synthesis Through Ultrathinking**:
   - Connect insights across multiple research files
   - Consider implementation realities, not just theory
   - Balance ideal solutions with practical constraints
   - Think about developer experience during implementation

4. **Specification Writing**:
   - Start with the "why" before the "what"
   - Provide concrete, runnable examples
   - Anticipate questions implementers will have
   - Reference specific research that influenced decisions

5. **Cross-Specification Integration**:
   - Each spec should reference others where relevant
   - Ensure consistency across all specifications
   - Identify dependencies between specifications
   - Create a cohesive system, not isolated documents
```

## SPARC Phase 2: Architecture - Foundation Setup [x]

### Phase Overview
```
Transform Phase 1 specifications into working foundation architecture.

**Purpose**: Implement the core technical foundation based on the comprehensive specifications created in Phase 1, establishing the CSS-first architecture, performance optimizations, and testing infrastructure.

**Critical Approach - Implementation with Specification Guidance**:
- Start EVERY task by consulting RESOURCES.md
- Locate and read relevant specifications from Phase 1
- Apply the integrated specification system (color → Tailwind → migration → quality)
- Document implementation decisions for future phases
- Test against quality gates defined in specifications
```

### Implementation Principles for Phase 2
```
For EVERY implementation task:

1. **Navigate via RESOURCES.md**:
   - Open RESOURCES.md first - it's your implementation guide
   - Use Quick Reference to find relevant specifications
   - Check Phase 1 Specification Insights for critical decisions
   - Review Cross-Reference Matrix for dependencies

2. **Apply Specifications, Don't Reinvent**:
   - Phase 1 specifications contain concrete implementations
   - Use the exact patterns and configurations provided
   - Follow the integration points identified
   - Respect the critical implementation order
   - Always intelligently and effectively use Subagents to perform discovery phases:
      - When multiple files need to read and analyzed, use multiple subagents to read and analyze them in parallel

3. **Test-Driven Implementation**:
   - Write tests based on quality gates from specifications
   - Implement to make tests pass
   - Validate against performance budgets
   - Ensure WCAG compliance per color system spec

4. **Document Implementation Reality**:
   - Create implementation docs in .claude/memory/implementation/
   - Note any deviations from specifications and why
   - Record performance measurements
   - Document lessons learned for Phase 3

5. **Maintain Specification Integrity**:
   - If reality differs from spec, document why
   - Update RESOURCES.md with implementation insights
   - Preserve the integrated system design
   - Think about Phase 3 components while implementing
```

### Critical Reminders for Phase 2

1. **Specifications are Implementation Blueprints**: Phase 1 specifications contain exact configurations - implement them faithfully
2. **Document Reality**: If implementation differs from specification, document why
3. **Think Forward**: While implementing, consider how Phase 3 components will use these foundations
4. **Measure Everything**: Capture metrics for comparison with baselines and targets
5. **Update RESOURCES.md**: This ensures Phase 3 can find everything needed

The foundation built in Phase 2 directly enables the success of all component migrations in Phase 3.

## SPARC Phase 3: Refinement - Component Migration

### Phase Overview
```
Transform the foundation architecture into a fully migrated application through systematic component updates.

**Purpose**: Migrate 70 components from dark mode to semantic colors by discovering and applying the extensive knowledge from Phases 0-2, building cumulative patterns that accelerate the work.

**Critical Approach - Progressive Learning Through Milestones**:
- Start with heavy discovery, building your pattern library
- Progress to confident pattern application as knowledge accumulates
- Culminate in efficient automation for the majority of components
- Maintain quality through verification at every stage
- **ALWAYS verify the reasonableness of your solution before you implement each piece of the solution**
```

### Migration Principles for Phase 3
```
For EVERY component migration:

1. **Navigate via RESOURCES.md**:
   - Open RESOURCES.md first - it maps all available knowledge
   - Use Quick Reference to identify potentially relevant topics
   - Check Implementation Documentation for similar work already done
   - Review Cross-Reference Matrix to understand dependencies

2. **Discover Applicable Knowledge**:
   - Research files: What component analysis exists?
   - Specifications: What patterns were designed for this type of component?
   - Implementation notes: What has already been proven to work?
   - Test results: What quality thresholds apply?

3. **Ultrathink About Application**:
   - How do the discovered patterns apply to this specific component?
   - What makes this component unique or challenging?
   - Which Phase 2 foundation elements will this component use?
   - What new patterns might this component reveal?

4. **Verify Before Implementation**:
   - **ALWAYS verify the reasonableness of your solution before you implement each piece of the solution**
   - Does this align with discovered architectural principles?
   - Will this maintain consistency with other migrated components?
   - Could this introduce regressions or break functionality?
   - Is this the simplest solution that achieves the goal?

5. **Test-Driven Migration**:
   - Discover test patterns from specifications
   - Apply quality gates found in research
   - Validate against discovered performance budgets
   - Ensure compliance with found accessibility standards

6. **Document for Accumulation**:
   - Create implementation docs for each component
   - Note patterns that could benefit future components
   - Track efficiency gains from reused patterns
   - Build toward automation threshold
   
**Pattern Evolution Note**: As you discover improvements to patterns, update the pattern definitions in CLAUDE.md. Apply refined patterns going forward. Only backport if you encounter issues with already-migrated components - consistency matters less than working code.
```

### Discovery Protocol (Use for Every Component)

Follow this systematic approach to maximize efficiency:

1. **Breadth Scan**:
   - Quickly scan RESOURCES.md Quick Reference
   - Note 3-5 potentially relevant files
   - Don't read deeply yet - just identify candidates

2. **Relevance Filter** - Match component type to resources:
   - Check component imports - are any already migrated? Use their patterns
   - Visual/styling → Color specs, CSS implementation, Card migration
   - Interactive → Animation research, tabs/switch examples, state management
   - Dynamic → Status utilities, ATS Score, conditional rendering
   - Forms → Auth components, validation patterns, input handling
   - Tables/Lists → Data display patterns, responsive behaviors
   - Performance-critical → Bundle optimization, code splitting examples

3. **Deep Dive**:
   - Read most relevant 2-3 files completely
   - Look for: Working patterns, warnings about pitfalls, validation approaches
   - Note: Specific code examples, test patterns, edge cases handled

4. **Synthesis**:
   - What patterns apply directly?
   - What needs adaptation for this component?
   - What's genuinely new and needs innovation?
   - What validation approach fits?

### Intelligent Subagent Usage for Discovery

Claude Code can run multiple subagents efficiently. Use parallel discovery when beneficial:

**Component Analysis Pattern** (run in parallel):
```
Subagent 1: "Analyze [component].tsx for all dark: classes and current color implementation"
Subagent 2: "Search RESOURCES.md and implementation/ for patterns related to [component-type]"  
Subagent 3: "Find all usages of [component] throughout the application to understand variants"
```

**Pattern Verification** (run after discovering a potential approach):
```
Subagent 1: "Check if this pattern appears in other migrated components in /implementation"
Subagent 2: "Verify this approach aligns with specifications in color-system-spec.md"
```

Maximum efficiency: Use 3-4 subagents per discovery phase when parallelism helps.

## Critical Performance Fix (Do First!)

### Task 3.0: 🚨 Optimize Resume Editor Bundle
```
CRITICAL: Resume editor is blocking Phase 2 success metrics. Fix before any component migration.
**Current Crisis**: 404KB (125% over 180KB target)

**Discovery Phase (REQUIRED)** - Intelligently and effectively use Subagents:
1. Navigate via RESOURCES.md to find:
   - Current performance metrics and how they were measured
   - Performance optimization patterns from any phase
   - Bundle analysis techniques and tools
   - JavaScript optimization strategies
   
2. Analyze the resume editor specifically:
   - What makes it so large? (404KB)
   - What dependencies does it have?
   - How was bundle analysis performed in Phase 2?
   - What optimization patterns were already discovered?

3. Ultrathink about optimization strategies:
   - Which Phase 2 optimizations could apply here?
   - What code splitting opportunities exist?
   - How can dynamic imports help?
   - What validation ensures functionality isn't broken?

**Critical**: Before implementing any optimization, **ALWAYS** verify:
- Will this preserve all editor functionality?
- Does this align with Next.js best practices discovered?
- Is this the simplest solution that achieves the goal?
- Have similar optimizations worked elsewhere?

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Apply discovered optimization patterns
   - **ALWAYS** verify each optimization won't break editor functionality
2. Measure bundle size reduction
3. Validate functionality preservation
4. Document successful techniques

**Documentation Requirements**:
Create .claude/memory/implementation/resume-editor-optimization.md:
- Discovery sources: [which files provided insights]
- Optimization techniques applied
- Bundle size: before → after
- Patterns reusable for other heavy components
- Validation approach used

**Before Moving Forward**:
- Bundle must be reduced to <180KB
- All editor functionality must work
- Document optimization patterns for other components
- Update CLAUDE.md with bundle size achieved

Commit: "perf: optimize resume editor bundle from 404KB to [new]KB"
```

### Systematic Category Coverage

Track coverage across all component categories to ensure patterns work universally:

**Coverage Targets for Phase 3B**:
- UI Components: 80%+ coverage (Alert completes this)
- Form Components: 80%+ coverage (Calendar, Label complete this)
- Interactive Components: 70%+ coverage (Toast helps this)
- Layout Components: Save for automation (simple patterns)
- Data Components: Save for automation (complex but repetitive)

**During Each Component Migration**:
1. Note which category it belongs to
2. Track if patterns from other categories apply
3. Document any category-specific patterns
4. Update coverage percentages in CLAUDE.md

**Assessment Questions**:
- Are patterns truly universal across categories?
- Which categories have unique requirements?
- What category-specific edge cases exist?
- Which categories are best suited for automation?

### Automation Readiness Assessment

**Continuous Tracking Requirements**:

After EACH component in Phase 3B, update CLAUDE.md with:

1. **Pattern Stability Check**:
   - Did any patterns need modification? If yes, document why
   - Were all changes predictable based on component type?
   - Could the changes be rule-based for automation?

2. **Time and Efficiency Metrics**:
   ```
   Component: [Name]
   Time taken: [minutes]
   Patterns reused: [list pattern numbers]
   New discoveries: [any unexpected findings]
   Automation feasibility: High/Medium/Low
   ```

3. **Error Tracking**:
   - Any verification failures?
   - Any unexpected behavior after migration?
   - Any patterns that didn't apply as expected?

4. **Automation Candidate Identification**:
   Track operations that are:
   - Highly repetitive (exact same replacements)
   - Rule-based (if X then Y patterns)
   - Low-risk (simple components)
   - Time-consuming (many instances)

**Phase 3C Go/No-Go Criteria** (document in CLAUDE.md):
- [ ] Pattern stability confirmed (no changes in final 5 components)
- [ ] 80%+ pattern reuse rate sustained
- [ ] Clear automation rules identified
- [ ] ROI calculation shows >10 hours saved
- [ ] Error rate remains <5%
- [ ] Test strategy for automated changes defined

### Phase 3B Reflection Checkpoint
```
After completing ~30 components total:

**Validation Complete**:
- Patterns proven across diverse components
- Edge cases documented
- Automation opportunities clear
- Efficiency gains measured

**Ready for Phase 3C Indicators**:
- Pattern reuse > 80%
- New discoveries rare
- Clear scripting opportunities
- Test confidence high

Make go/no-go decision for automation phase
```

**Remember**: The goal is confident automation, not rushed completion.

## Phase 3C: Automation & Scale (Components 31-70)

### Milestone Overview
```
**Focus**: Scripted migration for remaining components
**Expected Effort**: High initial automation investment, then minimal per component
**Key Outcome**: Rapid completion with consistent quality

**Trigger for Phase 3C**:
- Patterns stable (no changes in last 5 components)
- Clear automation ROI (>10 hours saved)
- Test strategy for automated changes defined
- Manual fallback process ready
```

### Task 3.15: Create and Execute Migration Automation
```
Build and run automation based on discovered patterns.

**Part 1: Script Creation**

Discovery Phase:
1. Review Pattern Library in CLAUDE.md for stable, automatable patterns
2. Analyze all patterns in CLAUDE.md
3. Review all implementation docs
4. Calculate automation ROI
5. Design script architecture

Script Components to Build:
1. Color replacement engine
   - Pattern matching rules
   - Semantic token mapping
   - Edge case handling

2. Component analyzer
   - Detect component type
   - Identify applicable patterns
   - Flag special cases

3. Test generator
   - Create migration tests
   - Visual regression setup
   - Validation suites

4. Documentation generator
   - Auto-create implementation docs
   - Track patterns used
   - Note manual interventions

**Proven Automation Examples from Phase 3A/B**:

1. **Pattern 1 Success**: Card component
   - Original: `dark:bg-gray-800 bg-white`
   - Automated to: `bg-surface`
   - Applied successfully to: Dialog, Popover, Alert (100% success)

2. **Pattern 5 Complexity**: Status colors
   - Original: Local STATUS_COLORS objects
   - Automated to: `getStatusClasses()` imports
   - Required verification for: Custom status mappings

3. **Pattern 9 Template**: Form components
   - Original: Various border/focus patterns
   - Automated to: Consistent `border-border focus:ring-ring`
   - Edge case: Radio groups needed special handling

**Automation vs Manual Decision Tree**:

START → Component has dark: classes?
├─ NO → Skip (already semantic)
└─ YES → Check complexity
    ├─ Simple (only Patterns 1-3) → AUTOMATE
    ├─ Medium (includes Pattern 5,9,11) → AUTOMATE with verification
    └─ Complex → Check specific factors
        ├─ Custom animations? → MANUAL
        ├─ >3 variants? → MANUAL
        ├─ Business logic? → MANUAL
        └─ None of above → AUTOMATE with careful review

**Part 2: Safe Execution Protocol**

Preparation:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b phase-3-automation`
2. Commit all manual work
3. Prepare rollback plan

Test Run (5 components):
1. Select diverse test components
2. Run scripts with verbose logging
3. Manual verification of results
4. Adjust scripts based on findings
5. Document success rate

Category-Based Execution:
1. Display Components Batch (~15 remaining)
   - Run script on category
   - Verify results
   - Handle exceptions manually
   - Commit batch

2. Form Components Batch (~10 remaining)
   - Apply form-specific rules
   - Verify functionality
   - Document variations

3. Interactive Components Batch (~10 remaining)
   - Check state preservation
   - Verify animations
   - Test interactions

4. Layout Components Batch (~5 remaining)
   - Simple patterns
   - Quick verification

5. Data Components Batch (~5 remaining)
   - Complex structures
   - Careful validation

Exception Handling:
- Components failing automation get manual migration
- Document why automation failed
- Update patterns if needed
- Track exception rate

**Common Automation Failures & Solutions**:

1. **"String to replace not found"**
   - Cause: Pattern variations not accounted for
   - Fix: Add regex flexibility, handle whitespace

2. **TypeScript errors after migration**
   - Cause: Missing imports for semantic utilities
   - Fix: Auto-add required imports in script

3. **Visual regression on hover states**
   - Cause: Not preserving hover: modifiers
   - Fix: Extend pattern matching to include pseudo-classes

4. **Build failures from missing tokens**
   - Cause: Using non-existent semantic tokens
   - Fix: Validate against globals.css token list

**Success Metrics**:
- 90%+ automation success rate
- <5% regression rate
- 10x efficiency gain
- Quality maintained

Commit: "tools: migrate [number] components via automation"
```

### Manual Exception Handling

## Progress Tracking Framework

### Milestone Progress Indicators
```
Phase 3A Progress (Discovery):
☑ Components: 26/15 (exceeded target)
☑ New patterns discovered: 13
☑ Pattern reuse rate: Started at 0%, reached 70%+ by end
☑ Avg time per component: 45min → 30min → 20min (decreasing as predicted)

Phase 3B Progress (Application):
☑ Components: 4/15 (strategy shifted due to pattern stability)
☑ Pattern reuse rate: 95%+ (exceeded 70% target)
☑ Automation candidates identified: 44
☑ Edge cases documented: 6 (OAuth colors, marketing gradients)

Phase 3C Progress (Automation):
☑ Scripts created: 4/4
☑ Components automated: 1/40 (only 1 needed migration!)
☑ Success rate: 97.5% (69/70 already semantic)
☑ Exceptions handled: 15 hardcoded colors documented
```

### Quality Metrics Throughout
```
Maintain across all milestones:
- Zero hardcoded colors
- Visual regression within tolerance
- All tests passing
- Accessibility preserved
- Performance neutral or improved
- Documentation complete
```

## Critical Reminders for Success

1. **Task 3.0 is MANDATORY FIRST** - Resume editor must be optimized
2. **Discovery scales down, efficiency scales up** - Natural progression
3. **Document patterns early** - Phase 3C depends on Phase 3A discoveries
4. **Verify before implementing** - Quality gate for every component
5. **Milestones are triggers, not deadlines** - Move when ready

## State Preservation Protocol

**Session Capacity Note**: Complex components with many variants or animations may fill context quickly due to detailed documentation needs. If discovery and implementation details become hard to track mentally, that's a natural signal to preserve state and request /clear.

**When Approaching Context Window Limits**:

1. **Update Progress Tracking**: Mark completed components in current milestone
2. **Update CLAUDE.md**: 
   - Add new patterns discovered
   - Update efficiency metrics
   - Note current milestone status
   - List next component to tackle
3. **Complete Documentation**: Ensure implementation doc is created
4. **Commit Changes**: Save all work to git
5. **Request Clear**: "I've completed [component] and updated all documentation. Ready for /clear to continue."

## Success Through Natural Progression

The milestone structure reflects how developers naturally work:
- Start by learning deeply (Phase 3A)
- Apply knowledge confidently (Phase 3B)  
- Automate repetitive work (Phase 3C)

Each component makes the next one easier. Each pattern discovered saves future time. Each milestone builds on the last.

By the end, you'll have migrated 70 components efficiently while maintaining high quality - not through rigid process, but through intelligent pattern recognition and application.

## Discovery-Based Development Guidelines

### Core Principle: Explore, Understand, Analyze, Apply

Rather than looking for specific files that may not exist, Claude Code should:

1. **EXPLORE** the `.claude/memory/` directory structure at the start of each task
2. **UNDERSTAND** what resources are available and how they relate to the current task
3. **ANALYZE** gaps in knowledge that could impact implementation success
4. **APPLY** both existing and newly researched knowledge to implementation decisions

### The Power of Gap Analysis

After exploring what exists (Task 0.5), identifying and filling knowledge gaps (Task 0.6) is crucial because:
- **Prevents Implementation Delays**: Missing knowledge won't block progress mid-task
- **Improves Quality**: Better understanding leads to better implementation decisions
- **Reduces Rework**: Fewer surprises mean fewer revisions needed
- **Strengthens Knowledge Base**: New research benefits all future tasks

### Discovery Pattern for Every Task

```
Task Start:
1. List contents of .claude/memory/ and subdirectories
2. Identify files that seem relevant to the current task
3. Read those files to gather comprehensive understanding
4. Note which files contain useful information
5. Apply the knowledge to implementation
6. Document which resources were helpful
```

### Common Discovery Scenarios

**When looking for "best practices":**
- Check all technology-specific files in /research/
- Look for patterns in migration specifications
- Read any quality gates or performance targets

**When implementing components:**
- Check /implementation/ for prior work
- Look for component-specific guidance in risk assessment
- Find patterns in migration specifications
- Read color system and Tailwind specs

**When writing tests:**
- Look for testing strategies in migration patterns
- Check for quality gates and coverage requirements
- Find accessibility standards in research

**When optimizing performance:**
- Find baseline metrics in research
- Look for performance budgets in specifications
- Check for optimization strategies in technology files

### Identifying Critical Knowledge Gaps

A gap is **CRITICAL** if missing it would:
- Block implementation of a core feature
- Cause significant rework later
- Risk breaking existing functionality
- Violate stated performance or quality targets
- Create security or accessibility issues

A gap is **IMPORTANT** if missing it would:
- Reduce code quality or maintainability
- Make implementation less efficient
- Miss optimization opportunities
- Require future refactoring

A gap is **NICE-TO-HAVE** if it would:
- Provide interesting context
- Offer alternative approaches
- Enhance documentation
- Support future features

Focus research time on CRITICAL gaps only to maintain project momentum.

### File Discovery Tips

1. **Use descriptive searches**: Instead of looking for "latest-standards.md", search for concepts like "CSS patterns", "best practices", "accessibility standards"

2. **Check multiple locations**: Specifications might be in root `.claude/memory/`, while research is in `/research/`

3. **Read file headers**: Most files have executive summaries or introductions that quickly indicate their content

4. **Cross-reference files**: Specifications often reference research, and research files may reference each other

5. **Document discoveries**: When you find useful information, note it for future tasks

### Success Indicators

You're using the discovery approach correctly when:
- ✅ You start each task by exploring available resources
- ✅ You work with what exists rather than searching for missing files
- ✅ You synthesize information from multiple sources
- ✅ You document which resources were helpful
- ✅ You add new discoveries back to the knowledge base

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Searching for specific files that don't exist
- ❌ Skipping tasks because a referenced file is missing
- ❌ Not checking /implementation/ for existing work
- ❌ Ignoring valuable content because it's in a different file than expected
- ❌ Not documenting which resources were useful

Remember: The goal is to leverage ALL available knowledge, regardless of where it's stored. The rich research and specifications from Phase 0 and 1 contain everything needed for successful implementation - Claude Code just needs to discover and use them effectively.

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback Commands
```bash
# Component-level rollback
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- [component-path]

# Feature-level rollback  
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/[feature]/

# Complete rollback
git revert --no-edit dark-mode-removal-start..HEAD
```

### Monitoring Thresholds
```javascript
const rollbackTriggers = {
  errorRateIncrease: 5,      // 5% increase
  performanceDecrease: 20,   // 20% slower
  accessibilityFailures: 1,  // Any failure
  bundleSizeIncrease: 50    // 50KB increase
};
```

## Notes for Claude Code Execution

1. **START with discovery** - Always explore .claude/memory/ before beginning any task
2. **IDENTIFY gaps early** - Use Task 0.6 to fill critical knowledge gaps before implementation
3. **BUILD upon existing work** - Check /implementation/ for work already completed
4. **USE what exists** - Work with available resources rather than searching for missing files
5. **DOCUMENT discoveries** - Note which files provided valuable information
6. **APPLY knowledge** - Use discovered patterns and specifications in implementation
7. **COMMIT frequently** with conventional commit messages
8. **UPDATE progress** in the plan after each task completion
9. **VALIDATE continuously** - Run tests after each change
10. **LEVERAGE all resources** - The rich Phase 0 and 1 work contains everything needed

### Key Success Factors:
- The discovery-based approach ensures flexibility when working with existing resources
- Gap analysis prevents implementation blockers
- Comprehensive specifications and research from Phase 0/1 provide strong foundation
- Progressive knowledge building strengthens the implementation over time
