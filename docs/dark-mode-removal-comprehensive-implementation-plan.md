# Victry Dark Mode Removal: Claude Code Optimized Implementation Plan

**File Name:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md`

## Project Configuration

**Project:** Victry Dark Mode Removal  
**Implementation Plan:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md` (this file)  
**Methodology:** SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)  
**Timeline:** 5 weeks (25 days)  
**Test Coverage Target:** 95%  
**Performance Target:** 25-30KB bundle reduction

## CRITICAL: Research-First Development Approach

**This plan emphasizes researching and utilizing the latest documentation and best practices before writing ANY code.** Claude Code must never rely on potentially outdated patterns or knowledge. Every implementation decision should be based on current (2024-2025) documentation and industry standards.

### Research Requirements for Every Task:
1. **Check Existing Research First**: Always check `.claude/memory/research/` for existing findings before conducting new research
2. **Build Upon Previous Research**: Reference and expand existing research rather than starting fresh
3. **Official Documentation**: Always check the latest official docs for all libraries
4. **Migration Guides**: Find recent migration guides and tutorials
5. **Best Practices**: Research current industry best practices and patterns
6. **Performance Standards**: Verify against 2025 performance benchmarks
7. **Security Updates**: Check for latest security recommendations
8. **Accessibility Standards**: Confirm current WCAG guidelines

### Research Utilization Strategy:
```
For every task requiring research:
1. First check: Does .claude/memory/research/[topic].md already exist?
   - If YES: Read it, verify it's still current, expand if needed
   - If NO: Conduct new research and document findings
2. Cross-reference: Check related research files that might inform this task
3. Apply findings: Use research to guide implementation decisions
4. Update research: Add new insights discovered during implementation
```

### Key Research Files to Check Before Any Task:
- **latest-standards.md** - General best practices and standards
- **[component-name].md** - Component-specific research
- **migration-patterns.md** - Established migration patterns
- **color-system-spec.md** - Color system specifications
- **wcag-2025.md** - Accessibility guidelines
- **performance-baseline.md** - Performance targets

All research findings must be documented in `.claude/memory/research/` for traceability and team reference.

### Research File Usage Example:
```
When implementing Task 3.2 (Migrate Card Component):
1. Check research files:
   - .claude/memory/research/card-component.md (specific research)
   - .claude/memory/research/latest-standards.md (general patterns)
   - .claude/memory/research/wcag-2025.md (accessibility)
   - .claude/memory/migration-patterns.md (established patterns)
2. Apply findings:
   - Use semantic HTML structure from card-component.md
   - Apply color tokens from color-system-spec.md
   - Follow accessibility guidelines from wcag-2025.md
   - Use migration pattern from migration-patterns.md
3. Document new insights discovered during implementation
```

## Notes for Claude Code Execution

1. **CHECK existing research first** - Always look in .claude/memory/research/ before researching any topic
2. **BUILD upon prior research** - Don't duplicate research efforts; expand and update existing findings
3. **CROSS-REFERENCE research files** - Related topics often have overlapping insights
4. **APPLY research to implementation** - Every technical decision should reference relevant research
5. **Use extended thinking** ("think hard" or "ultrathink") for architectural decisions
6. **Follow TDD approach** - Write tests before implementation
7. **Verify against current best practices** - Check if implementation follows 2025 standards
8. **Commit frequently** with conventional commit messages
9. **Update progress** in @dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md after each task
10. **Use parallel execution** where tasks are independent
11. **Validate continuously** - Run tests after each change
12. **Document decisions** in memory bank with rationale based on research

### Research Utilization Workflow:
```
Before ANY implementation:
1. List all relevant research files for the current task
2. Read each file completely
3. Note which findings apply to current task
4. Identify any research gaps
5. Only research what's missing
6. Apply combined knowledge to implementation
```

### Memory Storage:
- Use `.claude/memory/` for all persistent storage
- The `coordination/memory_bank/` directory is only needed for multi-agent scenarios
- For this single-instance project, `.claude/memory/` is sufficient

### Research Checklist for Each Task:
- [ ] Existing research files checked
- [ ] Research gaps identified
- [ ] New research conducted only for gaps
- [ ] Research findings applied to implementation
- [ ] Implementation decisions reference research
- [ ] New insights added back to research files
