# Victry Dark Mode Removal: Claude Code Optimized Implementation Plan

**File Name:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md`

## Project Configuration

**Project:** Victry Dark Mode Removal  
**Implementation Plan:** `dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md` (this file)  
**Methodology:** SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
**Test Coverage Target:** 95%  
**Performance Target:** 25-30KB bundle reduction

## CRITICAL: Research-First Development Approach

**This plan emphasizes researching and utilizing the latest documentation and best practices before writing ANY code.** Claude Code must never rely on potentially outdated patterns or knowledge. Every implementation decision should be based on current (2024-2025) documentation and industry standards.

### Research Requirements for Every Task:
1. **Official Documentation**: Always check the latest official docs for all libraries
2. **Migration Guides**: Find recent migration guides and tutorials
3. **Best Practices**: Research current industry best practices and patterns
4. **Performance Standards**: Verify against 2025 performance benchmarks
5. **Security Updates**: Check for latest security recommendations
6. **Accessibility Standards**: Confirm current WCAG guidelines

All research findings must be documented in `.claude/memory/research/` for traceability and team reference.

## Notes for Claude Code Execution

1. **ALWAYS research latest documentation** before writing any code - never rely on potentially outdated knowledge
2. **Store all research findings** in .claude/memory/research/ for reference and traceability
3. **Use extended thinking** ("think hard" or "ultrathink") for architectural decisions
4. **Follow TDD approach** - write tests before implementation
5. **Verify against current best practices** - check if implementation follows 2025 standards
6. **Commit frequently** with conventional commit messages
7. **Update progress** in @dark-mode-removal-comprehensive-implementation-plan.md after each task
8. **Use parallel execution** where tasks are independent
9. **Validate continuously** - run tests after each change
10. **Document decisions** in memory bank with rationale based on research
