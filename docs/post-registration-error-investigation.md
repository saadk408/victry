# Post-Registration Error Investigation

## Executive Summary

After a successful user registration and email verification, the application crashes on the dashboard page with a JavaScript ReferenceError. The root cause is a coding error in the PremiumUpgradePrompt component where it attempts to use an undefined `children` variable.

## Timeline of Events

1. User successfully registers with email/password
2. Email verification completes successfully  
3. User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
4. Dashboard page renders and crashes immediately with ReferenceError

## Primary Issue: ReferenceError in PremiumUpgradePrompt

### Error Details
```
ReferenceError: children is not defined
    at PremiumUpgradePrompt (premium-feature.tsx:163:35)
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The `PremiumUpgradePrompt` component in `/components/resume/premium-feature.tsx` has a critical bug:

1. **Component Definition** (line 44-48):
   ```typescript
   function PremiumUpgradePrompt({
     title,
     description,
     featureName,
   }: Omit<PremiumFeatureProps, "children">) {
   ```
   The component explicitly **excludes** the `children` prop using `Omit<PremiumFeatureProps, "children">`

2. **Component Body** (line 93):
   ```typescript
   {children}  // Error: children is not defined!
   ```
   The component tries to render `children` even though it's not in the props

### Why This Causes a Crash

When the dashboard renders:
1. `DashboardPage` renders `PremiumFeature` with children (the application tracking UI)
2. `PremiumFeature` renders `PremiumOnly` with a fallback of `PremiumUpgradePrompt`
3. Since the user is not premium, `PremiumOnly` renders the fallback (`PremiumUpgradePrompt`)
4. `PremiumUpgradePrompt` crashes trying to access undefined `children`

## Secondary Issue: Missing Database Function

### Error Details
```json
{
  "code": "PGRST202",
  "message": "Could not find the function public.get_user_permissions without parameters in the schema cache"
}
```

### Analysis

The `RoleBasedAccessProvider` component attempts to call a database function `get_user_permissions` that doesn't exist:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_user_permissions');
```

This causes:
- A 404 error in the network logs
- Console error logging (non-fatal)
- Potential issues with permission-based features

## User Experience Impact

1. **Complete Application Failure**: Users cannot access the dashboard after registration
2. **Poor First Impression**: The app crashes immediately after successful signup
3. **Lost User Trust**: Critical error at the most important user journey point

## Additional Observations

1. **User Authentication Works**: The user is successfully authenticated and has a valid session
2. **Profile Creation Works**: The user profile is created successfully in the database
3. **API Endpoints Function**: Resume and job description APIs return empty data (expected for new user)
4. **The Application Never Reaches Stable State**: Crashes before user can interact with any features

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix the `children` reference error in PremiumUpgradePrompt
2. **HIGH**: Create the missing `get_user_permissions` database function or remove the call
3. **MEDIUM**: Add error boundaries to prevent total application crashes
4. **LOW**: Improve error handling in the RBAC system

## Conclusion

The application has a simple but critical bug that completely breaks the user experience after registration. The fix is straightforward - either remove the `{children}` reference from PremiumUpgradePrompt or properly pass children to the component. The missing database function is a secondary issue that should also be addressed but doesn't cause the crash.
