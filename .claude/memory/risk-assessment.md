## Breaking Changes Assessment

### Component API Changes: ✅ NONE EXPECTED

**Rationale:** All migrations involve internal styling changes only. Component props, TypeScript interfaces, and public APIs remain unchanged.

```typescript
// BEFORE (card.tsx)
function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        "rounded-lg border bg-white text-gray-950 shadow-xs dark:bg-gray-950 dark:text-gray-50",
        className,
      )}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}

// AFTER (card.tsx) - API unchanged
function Card({ className, ...props }: CardProps) {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        "rounded-lg border bg-background text-foreground shadow-xs",
        className,
      )}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

### Import Statement Changes: ✅ NONE REQUIRED

All component imports remain identical:
```typescript
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
// No changes required in consuming components
```

### Runtime Behavior Changes: ⚠️ MINIMAL RISK

**Visual Consistency:** Components will maintain identical light mode appearance while removing dark mode variants.

**Accessibility:** No accessibility changes expected as semantic colors maintain WCAG compliance.

**Performance:** Reduced CSS bundle size (estimated 25-30KB reduction).

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Strategy

#### Level 1: Component-Level Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Restore individual component from backup branch
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/ui/[component].tsx

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

#### Level 2: Feature-Level Rollback (15 minutes)
```bash
# Restore entire UI component directory
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/ui/

# Restore any affected feature components
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/resume/
git checkout dark-mode-baseline -- components/auth/

# Full rebuild and deployment
npm run build && npm run test && npm run deploy
```

#### Level 3: Complete Project Rollback (30 minutes)
```bash
# Revert all dark mode removal commits
git revert --no-edit dark-mode-removal-start..HEAD

# Emergency deployment
npm run build && npm run deploy:emergency
```

### Monitoring Triggers for Rollback

```javascript
const rollbackTriggers = {
  // Technical Metrics
  errorRateIncrease: 5,          // >5% increase in JS errors
  performanceDecrease: 20,       // >20% slower page load
  bundleSizeIncrease: 50,        // >50KB unexpected bundle increase
  
  // User Experience Metrics  
  accessibilityFailures: 1,      // Any WCAG compliance failure
  visualRegressionFailures: 5,   // >5 critical visual breaks
  userFlowFailures: 3,           // >3 critical user flow breaks
  
  // Business Metrics
  conversionDrops: 10,           // >10% drop in sign-ups
  premiumCancellations: 15,      // >15% increase in cancellations
  supportTicketIncrease: 25      // >25% increase in UI-related tickets
};
```

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Trigger Level | Response Time | Action | Approval Required |
|---------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate (5 min) | Automatic rollback | CTO notification |
| **HIGH** | 15 minutes | Manual rollback | Engineering lead |
| **MEDIUM** | 1 hour | Hotfix or rollback | Product manager |
| **LOW** | Next deploy cycle | Scheduled fix | Team discussion |
