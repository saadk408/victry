## Gap Analysis Report
*Generated: January 16, 2025 during Task 0.7*

### Analysis Summary
- Files Analyzed: 13
- Total Gaps Identified: 8
- Critical Gaps: 2
- Important Gaps: 3
- Nice-to-Have Gaps: 3

### CRITICAL Gaps (Must Research)

1. **Tailwind v4 Animation System Migration**
   - Why Critical: Risk assessment shows tabs.tsx and switch.tsx use transitions/animations extensively
   - Current State: No detailed animation/transition patterns documented
   - Blocks: Tasks 3.2-3.7 (all component migrations that use animations)
   - Research Needed:
     * Tailwind v4 transition utilities in CSS-first approach
     * @keyframes implementation with @theme directive
     * Performance comparison: CSS animations vs JavaScript
     * Dynamic animation values using CSS custom properties

2. **Next.js 15 Build Optimization Configuration**
   - Why Critical: Performance targets require <1.5s build time (currently 2s)
   - Current State: Basic optimization research exists but concrete configuration missing
   - Blocks: Task 2.2 (Next.js Performance Configuration)
   - Research Needed:
     * Specific next.config.js settings for Tailwind v4 optimization
     * @next/bundle-analyzer integration and configuration
     * Turbopack setup for development performance
     * Critical CSS extraction with Next.js 15 App Router

### IMPORTANT Gaps (Should Research)

1. **Color Validation Script Implementation**
   - Why Important: Need to enforce semantic color usage across codebase
   - Current State: Concept identified but no implementation details
   - Affects: Quality gates, CI/CD pipeline, developer workflow
   - Research Needed:
     * AST-based color detection using TypeScript compiler API
     * ESLint plugin development for semantic color enforcement
     * Performance optimization for large codebases

2. **Playwright Visual Regression Configuration**
   - Why Important: Essential for validating no visual breaks during migration
   - Current State: Basic configuration research exists but needs specific setup
   - Affects: Tasks 3.2-3.7 (component migration confidence)
   - Research Needed:
     * Playwright visual comparison setup with tolerance levels
     * Baseline screenshot management strategy
     * CI integration with automatic visual diff reports

3. **OKLCH Browser Fallback Implementation**
   - Why Important: 6.9% of users need fallbacks (93.1% support mentioned)
   - Current State: Fallback strategy mentioned in oklch-color-system.md but not implemented
   - Affects: Production deployment and user experience
   - Research Needed:
     * PostCSS plugin configuration for automatic OKLCH→RGB conversion
     * CSS @supports detection patterns
     * Testing fallback rendering across browsers

### NICE-TO-HAVE Gaps (Acknowledged Only)

1. **Storybook 9 with Tailwind v4 Setup**
   - Useful for component documentation but not blocking implementation

2. **Real-time Performance Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Would help track improvements but can use existing tools

3. **Advanced OKLCH Color Manipulation**
   - Color mixing and dynamic themes are interesting but not required

## Gap Resolution Summary
*Updated: January 16, 2025 after research completion*

### Gaps Not Researched (NICE-TO-HAVE)

1. **Storybook 9 with Tailwind v4 Setup**
   - Status: NICE-TO-HAVE - Not Researched
   - Reason: Component documentation tool setup not critical for migration
   - Future Consideration: After successful migration completion

2. **Real-time Performance Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Status: NICE-TO-HAVE - Not Researched
   - Reason: Existing monitoring tools sufficient for migration validation
   - Future Consideration: Post-deployment enhancement

3. **Advanced OKLCH Color Manipulation**
   - Status: NICE-TO-HAVE - Not Researched
   - Reason: Basic OKLCH implementation sufficient for current needs
   - Future Consideration: Future theme system enhancement

### Implementation Impact

All CRITICAL and IMPORTANT knowledge gaps have been researched and resolved. Implementation can proceed with confidence through all phases. The research has provided:

- Complete animation migration patterns for tabs.tsx and switch.tsx
- Concrete Next.js configuration for achieving <1.5s build times
- Working validation scripts for enforcing semantic colors
- Full Playwright setup for visual regression testing
- OKLCH fallback strategy ensuring 100% browser compatibility

NICE-TO-HAVE gaps are documented for future consideration but do not impact implementation success.

## Phase 1 Specification Insights
*Added: January 16, 2025 after Phase 1 completion*

### Key Decisions Made
- **OKLCH Color Space**: Chosen for perceptual uniformity and P3 gamut support with automatic RGB fallbacks
- **Semantic Token Architecture**: Hierarchical system from primitive → semantic → component tokens
- **CSS-First Tailwind v4**: Leverages native CSS for 5x build performance improvement
- **Risk-Based Migration**: Components ordered by risk score (tabs.tsx highest at 8.5/10)
- **10% Visual Regression Tolerance**: Balanced between catching issues and allowing minor shifts
- **95% Test Coverage Target**: Aggressive but achievable with migration-focused testing

### Integration Points Identified
- **Color → Tailwind**: OKLCH tokens defined in color-system-spec.md are implemented via @theme in tailwind-v4-spec.md
- **Tailwind → Components**: CSS custom properties enable dynamic theming during migration
- **Migration → Testing**: Each component migration includes specific visual regression tolerances
- **Quality → Rollback**: Performance budgets directly trigger automated rollback procedures

### Critical Implementation Order
1. **Foundation Setup (Task 2.1)**: Must implement both color system AND Tailwind v4 together
2. **Status Colors First (Task 3.1)**: Required before any component migration
3. **High-Risk Components (Week 1)**: tabs.tsx and switch.tsx due to animation complexity
4. **Testing Infrastructure (Task 2.3)**: Must be ready before first component migration

### Implementation Readiness
- All specifications provide concrete, copy-paste examples
- Migration paths include step-by-step transformations
- Success criteria are measurable and automated
- Common pitfalls documented with solutions
- Phase 2 can begin immediately with clear guidance

## Usage Instructions (Updated for Phase 2+)

1. **For implementation tasks**: Check Quick Reference for relevant specs
2. **For architecture setup**: Start with color-system-spec.md + tailwind-v4-spec.md
3. **For component work**: Always consult migration-patterns.md first
4. **For validation**: Reference performance-budgets-quality-gates.md
5. **For decisions**: Check Phase 1 Specification Insights section

## Maintenance Notes
