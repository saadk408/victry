# Database Optimization Migrations

This directory contains a series of migration files to optimize the Victry database schema for improved performance, security, and maintainability on Supabase PostgreSQL.

## Migration Files

The migrations are sequenced to be applied in order:

1. **01_advanced_data_integrity.sql**
   - Adds custom domains for email, phone, URLs
   - Creates enum types for skill levels
   - Adds constraints for date integrity and validation
   - Adds version column for optimistic concurrency control

2. **02_optimized_indexing.sql**
   - Creates indexes for foreign keys
   - Adds BRIN indexes for efficient timestamp queries
   - Implements text search optimization with trigram indexes
   - Creates composite and partial indexes for common queries

3. **03_json_storage_optimization.sql**
   - Converts format_options and metadata to JSONB
   - Adds JSONB indexing for efficient queries
   - Creates helper functions for accessing JSON fields
   - Implements schema validation for JSONB fields

4. **04_row_level_security.sql**
   - Enables Row Level Security on all tables
   - Creates security policies for data access
   - Implements security helper functions
   - Ensures users can only access their own data

5. **05_audit_trail.sql**
   - Creates audit schema and tables
   - Implements triggers for tracking changes
   - Sets up efficient BRIN indexes for audit logs
   - Provides functions to query change history

6. **06_transaction_management.sql**
   - Creates stored procedures for complex operations
   - Implements error handling and recovery
   - Adds optimistic concurrency control
   - Creates functions for resume duplication

7. **07_performance_monitoring.sql**
   - Sets up pg_stat_statements extension
   - Creates functions to analyze database health
   - Implements monitoring for slow queries
   - Adds maintenance procedures

8. **08_materialized_views.sql**
   - Creates materialized views for common queries
   - Sets up refresh functions and triggers
   - Optimizes for listing and statistics operations
   - Improves read performance for common operations

9. **09_connection_pooling.sql**
   - Creates stateless functions for PgBouncer compatibility
   - Implements efficient data retrieval functions
   - Optimizes for connection pooling in Supabase
   - Reduces connection overhead

## Applying Migrations

To apply these migrations to your Supabase project:

1. Apply migrations in sequence using the Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

2. Or apply migrations manually through the Supabase SQL Editor:
   - Copy and paste each migration file into the editor
   - Execute them in the correct order

## Benefits

These optimizations provide:

- Improved query performance
- Reduced database load
- Better data integrity
- Enhanced security
- Easier maintenance
- Better monitoring capabilities
- Optimized connection usage
- Efficient audit history

## Considerations

Before applying these migrations to production:

1. Test thoroughly in a development environment
2. Backup your database
3. Apply during low-traffic periods
4. Monitor performance after each migration

## Future Improvements

Additional optimizations to consider:

- Table partitioning for extremely large tables
- Query cost limitations for public endpoints
- Advanced caching strategies
- PostgreSQL 15+ specific optimizations
